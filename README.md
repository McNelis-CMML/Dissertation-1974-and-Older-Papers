The thesis "A Simulation Analysis of Monetary Policy and Macroeconomic Adjustment" was my 1974 doctor thesis under the supervision of Jurg Niehans and Louis Maccini at Johns Hopkins. 
It was a pre-rational expectations research product:  expection inflation was based on a backward-looking adjustment.
The paper "Student Evaluations and the Assessment of Teaching Effectiveness" was written at Georgtown in collaboration with Martin D.D. Evans.
